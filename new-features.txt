New enhance the bot: adopt 3hours's PP SuperTrend buy/sell signal as bull/bear marketing sign.
  1. Supports the new command-line argument format (at=, fr=, tf=)
  2. Loads YAML configuration from account directories
  3. Checks 3H PP SuperTrend for market direction (bull/bear)
  4. Implements take profit logic based on risk/reward ratios according to market trend
  
Detail:
Pls change run cmd from:
  ./scripts/auto_trade.sh EUR_USD tf:5m sl:SuperTrend account1 
to: 
  ./scripts/auto_trade.sh at=account1 fr=EUR_USD tf=5m

The script will auto overwrite more params from ./account1/config.yaml (optional for other format if you think it is more easy)
The overwrite config includes:
check_interval: 60 (seconds), every 60s will check 3H's pp SuperTrend, and 5mins/15mins pp SuperTrend signals, etc.

marketing:
  indicator:
  - ppsupertrend (means: 3hours PP supertrend buy/sell signal as bull/bear marketing signal)
  - 3h

stoploss:
 trailing:PPSuperTrend  (which trailing 5min or 15mins's pp supertrend)
 
risk_reward:
  bear:
    sell=1.2
    buy=0.6
  bull:
    sell:0.6
    buy:1.2

Above risk reward ration implement logic:

During "bear" marketing trend: 
    5min/15m's sell postion, take profit risk/reward ratio: 1.2
    5min/15m's buy postion, take profit risk/reward ratio: 0.6

During "bull" marketing trend: 
    5min/15m's sell postion, take profit risk/reward ratio: 0.6
    5min/15m's buy postion, take profit risk/reward ratio: 1.2

e.g.:
During "bear" marketing trend: running ./scripts/auto_trade.sh at=account1 fr=EUR_USD tf=5m
    when sell postion reach 1.2 risk/reward ratio, take profit immediately
    when buy postion reach 0.6 risk/reward ratio, take profit immediately

During "bull" marketing trend: running ./scripts/auto_trade.sh at=account1 fr=EUR_USD tf=5m
    when sell postion reach 0.6 risk/reward ratio, take profit immediately
    when buy postion reach 1.2 risk/reward ratio, take profit immediately
 small profit(0.6))
